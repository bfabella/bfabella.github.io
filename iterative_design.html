				<p>I have <a
						href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=9mIu0_MAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate"
						target="_blank">a proven
						track record</a> of collaborating with scientists to develop the tools needed for their
					research. Using my skills and experience with <a href="hair_bundle_model.html"
						target="_blank">additive</a>
					and <a href="pfm_parts.html" target="_blank">subtractive</a> manufacturing,
					I then design, fabricate, and refine the apparatus as dictated by
					ongoing results.
				</p>

				<p>As one example, consider the work I did in research on mammalian hearing. Such research is often
					hindered by the fragility, anatomical inaccessibility, and complexity of the cochlea. In order to
					overcome these obstacles, we developed a chamber for excised cochlear segments that effectively
					mimicked the physiological environment of the intact cochlea. This approach also enabled us to
					fulfill a stringent set of experimental requirements, including stimulation with acoustic pressure,
					measurement of electrical responses, maintenance of optical access, and ease of pharmacological
					perturbations.</p>

				<p>Some initial designs and iterations of this chamber are shown above and to the left. <a
						href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.heares.2025.109288" target="_blank">Results</a> were consistent
					with an active process that endows hearing with exquisite
					sensitivity. However, those results were confounded by gravitational effects that altered the
					natural resting position of the cochlear segment. </p>

				<p>In conjunction with my colleagues, I developed a new chamber shown in the animation above that more
					closely approximated in vivo conditions and reduced gravitational effects. This chamber revealed <a
						href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2503389122" target="_blank">“a unified biophysical
						principle that underlies hearing across insects, nonmammalian
						vertebrates, and mammals alike.”</a> And as stated by Francesco Gianoli, this <a
						href=" https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/health/a69850851/mammalian-cochlea-ex-vivo/"
						target="_blank">breakthrough</a> allowed us to <a
						href="https://www.rockefeller.edu/news/38213-researchers-keep-a-mammalian-cochlea-alive-outside-the-body-for-the-first-time/"
						target="_blank">“observe the first steps of the hearing process in a controlled
						way that was previously impossible”</a>.
